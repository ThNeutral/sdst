## NOTES

- System requirement:
    - Global
    - Systematic
    - i.e. System should be accessable by X 

- Functional requirement:
    - Defines function but does not implement it (redactor note: as in interface?)
    - In our case, flip function and not functional

- Non-functional requirement:
    - Defines standarts and expected operating modes of system
    - i.e 500 persons have to be able to work simyltanously
    - i.e X security standart has to be implemented
